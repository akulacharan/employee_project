For CRUD in Django

Here we are using postgres sql

After creating models

make migrations by using:
	python manage.py makemigrations employee_register

also run sql migrations : python manage.py sqlmigrate employee_register 0001

Then migrate

create templates 
	base.html
	employee_form.html
	employee_list.html

Add bootstrap to it

For icons we also use 'cdn reference'
	google : font awesome cdn ,cdnjs.com
	copy this link rel "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.13.1/js/all.min.js"

Also add jumbotron in bootstrap

## Create forms.py and create a class for EmployeeForms
	in it you have to inherit all the fields in model Employee


import forms to the view employee_form {'form':form}

'pip install django-crispy-forms' for front end use
also add 'crispy-forms' to INSTALLED APPS
	Also specify the 'CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK='bootstrap4'
	in settings.py

# in employee_form  TOP add
	{% load crispy_forms_tags %}

	also modify {{forms}} to {{forms|crispy}}

# add positions to postgresql manually in employee_position (table)
	
	 # for not showing dashes(--)in position field
    
    def __init__(self,*args,**kwargs):
        super(EmployeeForm,self).__init__(*args,**kwargs)
        self.fields['position'].empty_label = "select"

for a change in button success bootstrap we use
	"fontawesome.com classes"
